# Claude Rules Authoring

Create reusable instruction files in `.claude/rules/` for project conventions.

## Rules vs CLAUDE.md

| Aspect  | CLAUDE.md                   | .claude/rules/          |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Loading | Automatic at session start  | On-demand via reference |
| Content | Project setup, key commands | Reusable conventions    |
| Size    | Concise (~200-500 lines)    | Can be detailed         |
| Scope   | This specific project       | Patterns across files   |

**Put in CLAUDE.md**: One-off instructions, project-specific commands, key file locations.

**Put in rules/**: Formatting conventions, architecture patterns, workflow guidelines, commit standards.

## File Conventions

### Naming

- **UPPERCASE.md** - All caps with `.md` extension
- **Topic-focused** - One concern per file
- **Kebab-case for multi-word** - `API-PATTERNS.md`, `CODE-REVIEW.md`

**Good**: `FORMATTING.md`, `TESTING.md`, `COMMITS.md`
**Bad**: `formatting.md`, `MyRules.md`, `everything.md`

### Structure

```
.claude/rules/
├── FORMATTING.md      # Code style, output conventions
├── TESTING.md         # Test patterns, coverage requirements
├── COMMITS.md         # Commit message format, PR conventions
├── ARCHITECTURE.md    # Component structure, file organization
└── SECURITY.md        # Security guidelines, auth patterns
```

## Content Structure

Rules files should be scannable and actionable:

```markdown
# Topic Name

Brief description of what this covers.

## Section 1

| Pattern | Example | Notes |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| ...     | ...     | ...   |

## Section 2

**Do:**

- Specific guideline

**Don't:**

- Anti-pattern to avoid

## Examples

{ concrete examples }
```

## Referencing Rules

### From CLAUDE.md

Reference rules explicitly - they're not auto-loaded:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Code Style

Follow `.claude/rules/FORMATTING.md` for all code conventions.

## Testing

See `.claude/rules/TESTING.md` for TDD patterns.
```

### Cross-file References

Use `@` syntax to include content from other files:

```markdown
# .claude/rules/FORMATTING.md

@./project-specific/FORMATTING.md
```

This keeps rules DRY by pointing to authoritative sources.

## Plugin Shared Rules

Plugins can organize shared rules internally:

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── skills/
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md      # Can reference ../../rules/FORMATTING.md
└── rules/
    ├── FORMATTING.md
    └── PATTERNS.md
```

**Important limitation**: Shared rules only work WITHIN a single plugin. When plugins are installed, Claude Code copies them to a cache directory. Paths that traverse outside the plugin root (like `../other-plugin/rules/`) won't work after installation.

**For cross-plugin patterns**: Use skill invocation instead of file references. Reference related skills by name (e.g., "load the **outfitter:formatting** skill") rather than file paths.

## Quick Start

### Create a New Rule

1. Identify the convention scope (formatting, testing, commits, etc.)
2. Create `TOPIC.md` in `.claude/rules/`
3. Write scannable content with tables, do/don't lists
4. Reference from CLAUDE.md

### Validate a Rule

- [ ] Filename is UPPERCASE.md
- [ ] Single focused topic
- [ ] Scannable structure (tables, lists)
- [ ] Referenced from CLAUDE.md
- [ ] No duplicate content with CLAUDE.md

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**

- Create rules for one-off instructions (use CLAUDE.md)
- Duplicate content between CLAUDE.md and rules/
- Create catch-all files like `EVERYTHING.md`
- Expect rules to auto-load (they must be referenced)

**Do:**

- Keep each rule file focused on one topic
- Use tables and lists for scannability
- Reference shared rules via `@` when available
- Document why, not just what
